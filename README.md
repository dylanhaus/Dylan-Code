This is where I will store my coding projects and files that I have created

*I am new to this so it wont be great but progress is progress.*

*Some of this stuff may be redundant or already implemented elsewhere but this way improves my skills*

#TextPy
In the Text Analysis with Python directory there is a Python 3 script that 
takes in text files and has a multitude of feautures/functions I will be adding 
in the future. Currently the only thing implemented is a function to count the 
number of lines that have an integer in them and the ones that don't. It will 
then display the lines do not have numbers in them. This script is run from the
command line 'python count_lines.py /Path/to/text/file' or it can be run on a directory with the -r option.

- **Count lines with and without numbers**
  - Use this to count lines that have integers in them and ones that dont.
  
    The ones that won't will be printed and their contents shown. 

- **Searching for keywords and their frequencies**


- **Getting general statistics on text file**
