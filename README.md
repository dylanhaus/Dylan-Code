# Dylan-Code
This is where I will store my coding files that I have generated 

In the Python Number Count directory there is a Python 3 file that will take in a text file and count the number of lines that have an integer in them and the ones that don't. It will then 
display the lines do not have numbers in them. This script is run from the command line 'python count_lines.py /Path/to/text/file' or it can be run on a directory with the -r option.
